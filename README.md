**Social Share Kit for Koken** is a library of decent and good looking CSS/JavaScript social sharing tools like **social network icons, share buttons, share count, floating/sticky button bar** and **popups**.


**Social Share Kit for Koken** is based on the original **[Social Share Kit](https://github.com/darklow/social-share-kit)** developed by Kaspars @darklow Sprogis

The only thing we have done, is to adapt the code to be able to run as a native Koken plugin.
